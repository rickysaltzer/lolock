LOLOCK README

Required Modules:
-- pyHook
-- pythoncom
-- mailer
-- VideoCapture & PIL

Install:
1.) Install the required modules
2.) Open video.py in a text editor (vi, notepad, etc)
3.) Head down to the settings section and make any appropriate changes

Usage:
1.) Double click video.py, it should perform a countdown...use this time to minimize the window. 
2.) Walk away from PC inconspicuously
3.) Wait for some stupid person to try and mess with your computer. 
4.) ???
5.) Profit

Note - To override the lock and exit out of lolock perform the magic key sequence, (ALT+J). This can be changed by modifying the KeyID if statement...I was a little too lazy to actually make it modular. 

Troubleshooting:
- If the application is just opening and closing then there may be an error loading one of the modules
-- Just open a command prompt and cd into the video.py directory and type "python video.py" to see the error message. 

Good luck!
